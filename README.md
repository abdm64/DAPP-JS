## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites


You need to install the fellowing software in order to get the application up and running 

 - Node.js and npm
 - Docker
 - Kubernetes on cloud

 ## Development environment

### Installing

- Download and Install node.js and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

 ## Running node.js application
- Download or clone the project code from https://github.com/abdm64/DAPP-JS.git

- Install all required npm packages by running npm install from the command line in the app folder (where the package.json is located).
```
cd app
```
```
npm install
```
- Before start the applcaition you should change keys ( account ) and token in order to get messeges from the the applcaition in you slack and telegram channel

- Start the application by running npm start from the command line in the app folder, you should see the message: Watching all pending transactions... .

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
## Docker

### Installing

- Download and install docker in your machine

- you need to  have the kubectl cammand line you can use Google kubernetes engine or other cloud platform or for test purpuse you install minikube in your machine 

### Build Docker image 

- Build your own docker image and push it to your repo  by running  "docker build -t my-app-name:v1 . "
   from the cammand line in app folder you can push it to your own registy 

```
cd app
```

```
docker build -t my-app-name:v1 .
```
###  Run Docker image 

- Run  your Docker image  for the application by the cammand 

```
docker run -e [inject your env variable here] my-app-name:v1
```
###  Docker compose 
- Also you can run the application as service by running  the fellowing cammand 

```
docker-compose up 
```

and the docker-compose.yaml handle all the task for you 

- to drop the running container use the cammand 
```
docker-compose  down 
```
## Kubernetes  GKE

- you should have access  to kubernets cluster GKE or you can download and install minikube in your machine 



- Please update  the eth-app.yaml file in the k8s folder with all needed information ( env var ) in order to the applcaion work 

- To run the application on kubernetes cluster ( GKE) just run the fellowing cammand 

```
kubectl apply -f k8s
```
